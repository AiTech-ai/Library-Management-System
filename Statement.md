## Problem Statement

Managing a library’s collections and member records has always been a demanding task, especially in smaller libraries that still rely on manual processes. Over time, keeping track of which books are currently available, which ones are borrowed, and who is responsible for them becomes extremely time-consuming. Staff may lose track of issued books or struggle to maintain reliable records, leading to confusion and occasional frustration among both librarians and members. With so much information to manage and the risk of registers becoming misplaced or damaged, even minor mistakes can result in unnecessary disputes or loss of valuable books.

Recognizing these challenges, this project proposes the development of a simple yet efficient Library Management System using Java. The primary aim is to offer a structured and dependable way to handle everyday library operations—adding new books, registering members, and recording which member has which book at any given time. By using a digital system, not only can we minimize human error, but we also allow library staff to access and update data much more quickly than possible with handwritten records. This transition can dramatically simplify the workflow in educational or community libraries and create a more organized environment where both books and member details are consistently up-to-date.

This project seeks to demonstrate how even a straightforward console-based software solution can make a significant difference in the way libraries operate. By leveraging core Java programming concepts, the system will facilitate daily tasks and ensure that information never slips through the cracks. Ultimately, the goal is to empower librarians and improve the library experience for everyone through reliable, accessible, and easy-to-use technology.

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes the development of a console-based application that manages the core operations of a library. The system focuses on:

  * Managing book records including addition, deletion, updating, and searching
  * Registering and maintaining member information
  * Handling book issue and return processes
  * Tracking availability of books
  * Displaying reports for issued and available books

The project is limited to small and medium-sized academic libraries.

## Target Users
The primary users of this system are:
  * Librarians / Library Staff – Responsible for managing books and members
  * Educational Institutions – Schools and colleges needing basic library automation
  * Students – Indirect users who benefit from accurate book availability and tracking

The system is designed to be simple and user-friendly which allows the non technical users to operate easily.

## High-level features 
* Book management (add, update, delete, search books)
* Member registration and record maintenance
* Book issue and return system
* Availability tracking of books
* Transaction history display
* Simple menu-driven interface
* Input validation and error handling
* Modular and scalable program structure
